### StuyHacks June 2018 Repo
### Joshua Weiner, Bill Ni

## Background
Bill is always feeling lonely and usually likes talking to someone, but nobody really likes him. So as a result, he developed a bot that can talk to him in times of need. Joshua just likes making things look pretty.

## Project
Jesse H. Cai is a bot that loves to talk. But be warned, Jesse CAN pick up on social cues. If you start giving Jesse 1-word answers, your chat will be dropped, so please don't treat him as such.

## Inners
Jesse works by comparing your input to a massive database of possible inputs and replying with a random appropriate response.

## Launch
Start by running the AI.py file, and then start it off with a greeting (i.e. Hello. or Hi.)! Remember to use proper GRAMMAR, CAPITALIZATION and PUNCTUATION. The rest is self-explanatory.
